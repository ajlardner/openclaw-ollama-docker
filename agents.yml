# Agent Definitions
# =============================================================================
# Define your agents here. Each gets its own OpenClaw instance, Discord bot
# token, and personality. One agent should be the administrator.
#
# Run: bash scripts/generate-compose.sh
# This reads agents.yml and generates docker-compose.agents.yml
#
# Required: each agent needs a Discord bot created at discord.com/developers
# Each bot needs to be invited to your experiment Discord server.
